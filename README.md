## WordPress on AWS ‚òÅÔ∏è  using Docker  , ECR  , and ECS 

This repository automates building a WordPress Docker image, pushing it to Amazon ECR, and then deploying it to AWS ECS!  

**What's included?**

* **Dockerfile Ô∏è:**  Defines the steps to build your WordPress image.
* **CI/CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**   : Uses GitHub Actions to automate the build, push, and deploy process on every push.

**Here's the magic ‚ú® :**

1. Push your code   to this repository.
2. The CI/CD workflow kicks in  ü™Ñ .
3. It builds a Docker image of your WordPress application   .
4. The image is then pushed to your ECR repository    (make sure to configure it!).
5. Finally, the image is deployed to your ECS cluster   for a smooth WordPress experience!

**Prerequisites:**

* An AWS account with ECR and ECS configured.
* Docker installed locally.
* An existing WordPress codebase (optional, you can use a default one).

**Getting Started:**

1. Configure your AWS credentials and ECR repository details in the CI/CD workflow file (`secrets.env`). (**Note:** These secrets should not be committed to the repository!)
2. (Optional) Customize the Dockerfile for your specific WordPress needs.
3. Push your code to this repository, and the deployment magic happens! ‚ú®

**Built with love using:**

* Docker  
* AWS ECR
